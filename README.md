## Description

A sample ticket control application.

## Installation

First, set up the database (postgres container) by running the docker compose file 'postgres-docker.yml'.

Next, run this command in the console:

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
$ npm run start
```

The application will run on localhost:3000. Easiest way to play around with the application is to go to the OpenAPI interface for the application, which is found at localhost:3000/api 

The more complicated way is to also install the Frontend application and use it to interact with this application.
